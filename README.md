# The Ultimate Sandwich Survey

Sandwiches are a staple part of many people’s diets, particularly in western culture. However, little data exists on sandwich eating habits today. 

Thank you for taking part in the super sandwich survey! This repository will be used as a reference guide for anyone taking part in the survey. Your responses will contribute to a larger resource on people’s experiences with sandwiches. 

## In this repository you will find:
- A csv file which is used to log a new sandwich that is not currently in the sandwich database 
- A instructions file which details features of this csv file
- A recipe file containing recipes for the example sandwiches
- A FAQ file for the app
